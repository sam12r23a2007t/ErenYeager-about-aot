                    <h1>Related to WW2</h1>
                    Though Attact on Titan is about freedom from titans, killing titans and curse of Ymir etc but it
                    also have a inner meaning that is highly related to WW2. The Eldians in Marley were treated just
                    like how the jews were treated in Germany during the WW2 period and not to say that Rumbling or the
                    marley genocide was just like jews genocide in Germany by Hitler and Eren symbolises Hitler. The
                    Eldians in Marley have to wear bands on their hands were just like jews were also forced to wear
                    bands. The freedom of Eldians were also taken does also represents the jews restrictions. There are
                    several other things that symbolises to WW2.

                    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                    In the end i wanna conclude that Attact on Titan is lot more than it is shown it has a deep meaning
                    inside and communicates with us not only on the suface but also inside or under the surface, it has
                    a secondary meaning that is hidden and interlinked to our real life. We only sees the tip of the
                    iceberg but the beneath part is always hidden and very deep. The story deals with many mature topics
                    while being hidden.
